# Portfolio

## Desription 

The purpose of creating this portfolio is to create a virtual document displaying my work, work experience, educational background, and general information about me. Part of the motivation to create this portfilio is to allow future employeers to get to know me better, and to also demonstrate my ability to create a webpage portfolio using html and CSS. I truly enjoyed the process of creating my own html document and adding my own css code to create something that represents me. I know that employers do want to see work from employee candidates and this webpage solves that problem by showcasing to other what I can do with my skill set. I learned a lot about to create things in html and css, but something I really enjoyed learning from this process is how to problem solve and use develolment tools to make the process of building and debuging easier.

The Portifolio includes a header with my name, profile pic, and navigation links to sections on the portfolio. The links will link to the appropriate sections in the portfolio. The portfolio also displays 5 applications with images for each application. Each image is also a link that takes the user to the website of the application. At the very bottom is the contact me footer with a list of links to contact me by phone, email, or through various socia media apps.
